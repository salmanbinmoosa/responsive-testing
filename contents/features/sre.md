Problem Statement:
    Enterprises today need to adopt modern microservices/serverless architecture in multi-cloud hybrid environment for business agility, scalability, and flexibility. Every enterprise has many products and their environments and corresponding App and Data Services float across multiple clouds, managing the cost and SLAs of all these services spread across multiple clouds is exponentially complex.
 
Remedy:
-   Right tools that can process data points of numerous services in multi-cloud hybrid environment that can deliver high data revenues.

How AppKube Helps:

-   Enterprises today have multiple products owned by different departments, 
    deployed across multiple clouds. Each product has multiple environments, 
    many services, and associated components. Managing all the 
    Development/Security/Operation aspects of them poses exponential complexity 
    and thereby causing huge OpEx. It takes significant time to provision the 
    cloud environment for any product for any team without having self-service-based provisioning portal and it also takes tremendous effort to establish monitoring 
    and visibility of products and their services - especially the 
    Performance/Availability/Reliability/Security/End-Usage of every participating 
    component once the products are deployed in cloud.

    Customers are looking for a single control plane to manage any cloud and any service 
    in the same way. They are looking for a platform to do self-service-based provisioning 
    and reclaiming of the cloud assets. They are also looking for standard operation 
    and governance processes that work seamlessly for different clouds in the same way. 
    Finally, they look for simplicity to manage multi-cloud hybrid environment.

AppKube platform discovers all services residing on any cloud and any infrastructure,whether they are legacy 3-tier Apps or Container/Serverless modern Apps. It allows to manage the service lifecycle (create/deploy/update/delete/getstats/scale), continuously collect the SLA (Performance/Availability/Reliability/End-Usage/Security/Compliance/Data-Protection) and Cost statistics from different data sources and deliver business friendly KPA's to measure service reliability. It will gather data points on every small detail of service and calculate its SLAs like Performance, Availability, Reliability, End-Usage, Security in real time and predicts customer experience based on proven AI models. AppKube platform corelates your infrastructure with business apps and helps you dig details from services to bottom of infra, to an extent of your data spindle path. It’s a bird’s-eye view of all services for every product that helps you to identify and optimize your infra and continuously improve your customer experience along with the lowering of CapEx and OpEx. AppKube draws a clear visibility of service development perspective. It helps you to have more control over Development processes if you are building your own product and services.
