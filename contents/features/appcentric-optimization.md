Problem Statement:

Most Enterprise land up excessive cloud CapEx/OpEx after few months of cloud adoption, because of two reasons:

-   Actual Vs Non-Actual Ratio
-   Resource Oversizing with Primitive Model

Remedy:

-   Infra - Business Correlation
-   Modernization & Right Fitment

How AppKube Helps:


Enterprises that have already moved to the cloud tend to have higher CapEx/OpEx costs in the cloud. This is mainly due to incorrect discovery analysis, resource allocation and cost analysis, resources being over-provisioned and underutilized. Development teams have provisioned cloud resources that do not directly serve the actual business. The cloud resource consumption for Actual Vs Non-Actual business is 10:90. On average only 10% of cloud assets supports Production workload and 90% of resources are scattered in Dev/Stage/Test environments. For enterprise that has annual cloud billing of $200 Million with this 10:90 ratio will have significant financial loss in cloud CapEx. This necessitates the process of identifying and re-claiming the resources that are not used for actual business.  Most enterprises today have no visibility on their Production workloads vs non-Production workloads spent ratio, have got little clarity on their cloud billing. Furthermore, unmanaged and unclaimed cloud resources create Security loopholes and greater operational risks.

This is where AppKube can help Enterprises achieve cost-effective, secure, scalable, and optimized cloud solutions.
