Most of them fail to adopt right strategy and best patterns, combat with the steep learning cycle of cloud and fill the skilling gaps.Most migration project get started without having a accurate discovery and transformation path. Also while migrating to cloud,a huge amount of time is spent in establishing a management platform to manage multiple products in clouds and 	thereafter creating the secure product enclave for each product and associated services and environments and establishing their continuous build/deploy/security/compliance/monitoring. Also changing existing governance processes, gates and approval procedures designed for traditional legacy IT environments to work in multicloud hybrid environment running microservices/ serverless products in distributed environment takes enormous time.
